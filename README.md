Unofficial modification for the official PlayStation VR2 driver/app, which aims to improve your PlayStation VR2 experience on PC.

## Features
- Eye tracking\*
- Improved controller prediction
- Improved controller haptics (w/ PCM haptics)
- Adaptive triggers

For developers, we also have our own API library, which allows you to take full advantage of these features.

\* Eye tracking calibration is currently not available yet, we have a few things to work out before we are ready to ship this feature!

## Installation Guide

### Automated Installation (Recommended)

We provide PowerShell scripts to automate the installation process safely:

**Install:**
```powershell
.\scripts\driver-install.ps1 -SourceDll .\driver_playstation_vr2.dll
```

**Restore (Uninstall):**
```powershell
.\scripts\driver-restore.ps1
```

The scripts will:
- Automatically locate your Steam installation
- Back up the original Sony driver
- Install/restore the driver files
- Verify the installation
- Create a log file for troubleshooting

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually or the automated script fails:

1.) Open Steam, go to the PS VR2 app, click on the cog wheel, and go to "Manage -> Browse local files". (If you are using a copy of the PS VR2 app not installed by Steam, go to that instead.)

2.) Inside the newly opened file explorer, go into "SteamVR_Plug-In", then "bin" and finally "win64".

3.) Rename "driver_playstation_vr2.dll" to "driver_playstation_vr2_orig.dll" (**IT MUST BE CALLED "driver_playstation_vr2_orig.dll", DO NOT RENAME IT TO ANYTHING ELSE, IT MUST BE EXACTLY THAT**)

4.) Download the "driver_playstation_vr2.dll" attached in a release, and copy/move it into the same folder where "driver_playstation_vr2_orig.dll" is at.

5.) Your "win64" directory should now have 2 DLL files inside it, "driver_playstation_vr2.dll" and "driver_playstation_vr2_orig.dll". If you do not have both of those files, you fucked something up.

6.) Enjoy your new features, please give us feedback in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/dPsfJhsGwb).
